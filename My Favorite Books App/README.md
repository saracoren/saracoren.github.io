<h2>Insiration</h2>
This application can be used by anyone who wants to keep a record of the books they would like to read next and the books they have finished reading. However, I originally designed this application for students to keep track of the books they are reading in the classroom and I believe that this could be a very powerful tool for students and educators alike.  As an experienced educator in many different elementary classroom settings, I know how imperative it is for emerging readers to engage in meaningful reading every single day.  One hurdle to acheiving this outcome is that students usually have a specified time block in which to practice their independent reading in the classroom and oftentimes students spend 5-10 minutes or sometimes even longer simply trying to find a book they want to read while losing precious time to engage in doing the actual work of reading.  My hope in creating this applicaiton is that students would be excited to seach for new books to read and add them to their digital book lists.  This is not only a motivational tool, but also a tool to keep students accountable for having books ready to read and for finishing one book before jumping to a new book since students abandoning books midway through reading is also a common practice of inexperienced readers.  Teachers could benefit by using this application as well by accessing their students' virtual book lists to quickly check that students are prepared for reading time each day and to make sure that selected books are the appropriate level for the reader.

<h2>How To Use the App</h2>
This application is very simple and easy to use!  You simply type in the title of any book you want to find, and the app with access the Google Books API database to locate the book information for you.  When your book first appears on the page, it will appear with a thumbnail image in the "Books I Want to Read" column.  Here you can click the buttons to open a blurb with summary information about the book, move the book to the "Books I've Finished Reading" column, or delete the book altogether from your list.  Similarly, if you have moved the book into the "Books I've Finished Reading" column and you want to move it back to the first column, simply click the "Move" button again. You can add as many books as you want to your list and the page will expand.

Please note: This application does not have local storage as of yet, so any items you place on your list cannot be saved at this time.
